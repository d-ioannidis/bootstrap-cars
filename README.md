A website designed for a university assignment. It includes information about electric vehicles in the foreseeable future, the visitor being able to search through a car database in order to find characteristics of a specific model they want. This happens through a query towards the database. The website also includes an authentication system, where the visitor is able to register themselves as a member. Overall, the authentication system includes:

* A register form where the user is able to become a member.
* A login form where the user can log-in after registering.
* A forgot password form where the user can change his password in case he forgot his old one.
* A delete account form if the user wants to delete his account.

There's also a contact form which allows a visitor to come into contact with me. The form's content is saved on a database table, and there's a local SMTP Server set up where email can be sent to our website email (e.g info@electric-cars.com). Lastly, there's an Explore section which includes a Tableau Data Analytics chart where a visitor or user can gain insight through the various charts shown in the story.

Used technologies are:
* HTML
* CSS (Bootstrap v5.0)
* PHP
* MySQL (phpMyAdmin)
* MailHog Service (local SMTP Server)
* LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, to run servers locally on Linux Mint)
